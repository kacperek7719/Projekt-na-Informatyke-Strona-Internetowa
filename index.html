Jarząbkowski began his career playing Counter-Strike 1.6 in amateur teams. His breakthrough came in February 2010 when he joined Frag eXecutors, with whom he achieved 3rd place at World Cyber Games 2010.

With the release of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) in 2012, pashaBiceps transitioned to the new version of the game. On January 25, 2014, he joined Virtus.pro, forming a legendary lineup that secured numerous international victories. His major achievements with the team include winning EMS One Katowice 2014, StarLadder i-League Invitational #1, ELEAGUE Season 2016, and DreamHack Open Bucharest 2016, among others.
In late 2018, he stepped down from the active roster of Virtus.pro but remained affiliated with the organization in an undisclosed role. In February 2019, he officially parted ways with the team.
